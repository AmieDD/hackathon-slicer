## About
This project is a tiny slicer for DLP printers.

It runs in your browser, using WebGL and the stencil buffer to voxelize
`.stl` files.  The resulting slices are delivered as a zip file full of
`.png` images.

A hosted version and further documentation can be found
[here](http://mattkeeter.com/projects/dlp)

## Disclaimer
This was written by two folks with zero experience in modern javascript
over the course of two days.  It's a cool demo, but shouldn't be considered
industrial-strength software.
